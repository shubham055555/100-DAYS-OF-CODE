💻 Day 10 | hashtag#100DaysOfCode Challenge
Double digits reached! 🎯
 Today I focused on solving string problems that tested my logic on frequency counting and character-based operations 🧠
Solved the following problems:
 1️⃣ First Unique Character in a String
 2️⃣ 2351. First Letter to Appear Twice
 3️⃣ Valid Anagram
 4️⃣ Check if the Sentence Is Pangram
🧩 Key Learnings:
Improved use of frequency arrays & HashMaps
Strengthened logic for pattern recognition and character validation
Practiced edge-case handling in string-based problems
🚀 Each day adds up — step by step, line by line!
