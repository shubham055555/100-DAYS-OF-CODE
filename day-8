💻 Day 8 | hashtag#100DaysOfCode Challenge
Today I continued exploring matrix-based problems on LeetCode, focusing on traversal and rotation techniques 🧮
Solved the following problems:
 1️⃣ Search a 2D Matrix II
 2️⃣ Rotate Image
 3️⃣ Spiral Matrix
 4️⃣ Diagonal Traverse
🧠 Key Learnings:
Strengthened logic for 2D matrix traversal and boundary conditions
Practiced in-place rotation techniques
Enhanced understanding of patterns and index manipulation in matrices
🚀 One more day closer to mastering DSA — consistency is the real power!
