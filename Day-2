🚀 Day 2 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode Challenge!
Today I started my coding consistency journey to strengthen my problem-solving and DSA skills using LeetCode (Java).
 I solved 4 problems today 👇
1️⃣ Reverse Integer
 2️⃣ Palindrome Number
 3️⃣ Happy Number
 4️⃣ Sum of Digits
🧠 Key Learnings:
Practiced loops, conditionals, and modular arithmetic
Understood integer manipulation without string conversion
Strengthened logic building using HashSet and while loops
Every small step adds up — consistency is the key! 🔑
