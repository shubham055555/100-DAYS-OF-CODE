💻 Day 6 | hashtag#100DaysOfCode Challenge
Another productive day of sharpening my problem-solving skills on LeetCode 💡
 Today I solved the following problems:
1️⃣ Sort Colors
 2️⃣ Majority Element
 3️⃣ Maximum Subarray
 4️⃣ Two Sum – Pair with Given Sum
🧠 Key Learnings:
Strengthened concepts of array partitioning and element frequency
Practiced Kadane’s Algorithm for maximum subarray sum
Reinforced logical thinking through multiple array-based approaches
🚀 Consistency turns complexity into clarity!
