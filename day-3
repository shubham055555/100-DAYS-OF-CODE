Continuing my LeetCode learning journey — today I solved 3 more problems focused on logic building and recursion 🔁
🧩 Problems I solved today:
 1️⃣ 509. Fibonacci Number

 2️⃣ 50. Pow(x, n)

 3️⃣ 1137. N-th Tribonacci Number
🧠 What I learned:
How recursion works and when it’s better to use iteration for optimization.
Handling base cases carefully in mathematical problems.
Learned about time complexity optimization using fast exponentiation and dynamic programming.
Slow progress is still progress 💪
 Consistency > Intensity 🌱
