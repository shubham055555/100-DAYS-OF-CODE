🚀 Day 1 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode
Today, I officially started my 100 Days of Code challenge to strengthen my problem-solving and programming logic.
 I practiced 3 beginner-friendly problems on LeetCode that helped me revise core Java concepts like loops, conditions, arrays, and logic building 👇
🧩 Problems I solved today:
 1️⃣ #1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank

 → Learned about arithmetic progressions and loop optimization.
2️⃣ #1154. Day of the Year

 → Understood date parsing, leap year logic, and array-based month calculations.
3️⃣ #204. Count Primes

 → Implemented the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm efficiently.
💡 Key Takeaway:
 Even simple problems can teach deep concepts if you focus on logic and clean code.
